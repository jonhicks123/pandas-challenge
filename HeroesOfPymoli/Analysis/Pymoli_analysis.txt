3 Observable Trends from Heroes of Pymoli

-----------------------------------------

1. Males make up a vast majority of the players for Heroes of Pymoli at 84%, having the lowest average purchase price among genders as well as the highest total purchase value. This implies that males bring in the most revenue compared to other genders.

2. The 20-24 age group makes up a significantly large percentage of those who play the game, at 44.79% of total players. The next two closest age groups are 15-19 and 25-29, meaning the game stands out the best to those in the 15-29 age group. If Heroes of Pymoli were to increase marketing efforts to any age group, it would be best to target those two surrounding age groups to gain more young players, as they fit the age demographic of people who are most attracted to playing the game and purchasing additional items.

3. Though males make up most of the players, females and other spend more than men, as they both have higher average purchasing prices both in total and per person. Finding a way to target this game to more females and non-disclosed individuals could easily end up being profitable.
