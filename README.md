## Acting as Lead Analyst for an imaginary game called Heroes of Pymoli.

The purpose of this challenge is to simplify the data and uncover trends by using pandas in Jupyter Notebook. 
The background concept of this challenge, is that Heroes of Pymoli is a free game that offers players the 
option to make in-app purchases for items that can give them a competitive edge over other players.

### In this challenge, I generated a report that lists the following:

###### Player Count (Number of unique players) 

###### A Purchasing Analysis consisting of:

- Number of Unique Items
- Average Purchase Price
- Total Number of Purchases

###### Gender Demographics, which shows the Percentage and Count of players separated by Gender

###### Purchasing Analysis by Gender, which shows each of the following broken up by gender:

- Purchase Count
- Average Purchase Price
- Total Purchase Value
- Average Purchase Total per Person

###### Age Demographics, which shows the Percentage and Count of players separated by Age Group.

###### Purchasing Analysis by Gender, which shows each of the following broken up by Age Group:
